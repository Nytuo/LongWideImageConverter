 Did you ever wanted to have all your images in only one ? Now it's possible.

This little python Program help you to have all your images in one file!
I made it to get one image of my manga/comics which are miscropped (but can be used in other ways).

To use it, very simple, run the python file in a IDE with the PIL (pillow) module installed and follow the instructions on screen.
- Enter the path of the directory containing the images.
- Enter the path of a directory which will contains the new one.
- Indicate if it is a manga or not (IF you want it reversed or not)
- Wait until it's finish
